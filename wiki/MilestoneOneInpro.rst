#summary Defining the capabilities to be demonstrated at Milestone INPRO_01
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

This is an early milestone for Cyclus development based on a simple once-through INPRO study.

*Target Date: 8/31/2010*

= Details =

This will build on the capabilities of MilestoneNullSimulation by adding:
  * EnrichmentFacility Model
  * DeployInst Model (or DeploymentRegion Model)
  * support for Decay in the Material class
  * RecipeReactorFacility Model

There will also need to be some output methods/formatting and minor post-processing.

The INPRO cases are not freely available, but Paul Wilson can be contacted for details.
