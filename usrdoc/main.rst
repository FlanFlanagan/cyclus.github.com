Doxygen Code Documentation
--------------------------

The definitive documentation of any software is the source code itself.
*Cyclus* relies on Doxygen for automation of rich documentation from
appropriately formatted comments in the source code. 

Instance descriptions and parameter definitions for models available to
*Cyclus* simulations are made available in this documentation, which can be 
found at http://cnerg.engr.wisc.edu/cyclus/docs/ . This page is automatically 
updated nightly.
