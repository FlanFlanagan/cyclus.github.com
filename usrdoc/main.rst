Documentation to assist with the use of *Cyclus* will be maintained in a
variety of forms.

Installation
------------

An instruction manual for :doc:`../basics/get_and_build` is provided.
Questions having to do with this process may be directed to the
`Cyclus Developer's List <cyclus-dev.googlegroups.com>`_.

Model Definitions
-----------------

Instance descriptions and parameter definitions for models available to
*Cyclus* simulations are made available on this wiki and can be browsed from
the TableOfContents to the left of this text. As new Models and Utility
functions are defined, wiki pages will be added to describe them.

Doxygen Code Documentation
--------------------------

The definitive documentation of any software is the source code itself.
*Cyclus* relies on Doxygen for automation of rich documentation from
appropriately formatted comments in the source code. Current Doxygen
documentation can be found at http://cnerg.engr.wisc.edu/cyclus/docs/ . This
page is automatically updated nightly.
