.. summary Description of Cyclus Ecosystem

========================
 The *Cyclus* Ecosystem
========================


An important goal of the *Cyclus* effort is to attract a community of
developers contributing to a vibrant ecosystem of models for use by
users.  

Characteristics:

* Open Source Base Infrastructure
* Decentralized Module Distribution
* Distribution Authorization by Owner
* Peer-review QA and Rating
* Curation and Collections

Open Source Base Infrastructure
================================

The *Cyclus* base infrastructure provides a generic environment for
modeling flows of materials among a collection of nuclear facilities.
Although this infrastructure could be used for modeling many different
supply chain scenarios, nuclear and non-nuclear, there are some
specific capabilities that are oriented to facilitate the former.

This core infrastructure includes the critical functions for an agent-based time-stepping solution paradigm, including 

A critical feature of this infrastructure is the run-time plug-in
paradigm for development of individual modules.  

Decentralized Module Distribution
